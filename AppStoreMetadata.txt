Description:
Keep your motorcycle in peak condition with Moto Service Log — a visual maintenance tracker built for riders who care about their machines.

Your dashboard shows arc-gauge indicators for every critical service: oil, tires, chain, brakes, spark plugs, and coolant. Each gauge fills from green to yellow to red as service intervals approach, so you always know what needs attention — at a glance.

KEY FEATURES:

• Arc Gauge Dashboard — Six animated arc indicators show remaining service life. Green means good, yellow means due soon, red means overdue.

• Digital Odometer — Motorcycle-style odometer display with your current mileage, always visible on the main screen.

• Service Log — Record every oil change, tire swap, brake job, and more. Search by keyword, filter by service type. Never lose track of what you've done.

• Fuel Tracking — Log every fill-up with liters, price, and odometer reading. See your average consumption (L/100km) calculated automatically. Visualize fuel costs with bar charts.

• Cost Analytics — Pie chart shows where your money goes (oil vs tires vs brakes etc). Monthly trend chart breaks down service and fuel spending over time.

• Reference Guide — Quick-access tables for tire pressure (sport/touring/off-road), chain slack measurement and lubrication intervals, engine oil specs (JASO MA2), coolant, and brake fluid recommendations.

• Customizable Service Intervals — Set how often each service type is due (in km). The dashboard automatically calculates urgency from your last record.

• Data Export — Share all your data as JSON via the built-in ShareLink. Perfect for backup or transferring to a new device.

• Motorcycle Profile — Store your bike's name, make, model, year, fuel tank capacity, and current mileage.

Whether you ride a sportbike, touring machine, or ADV — Moto Service Log helps you ride with confidence knowing every service is tracked and every interval is monitored.
