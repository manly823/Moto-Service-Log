📖 DESCRIPTION (PLAIN TEXT ONLY, NO EMOJIS, NO BULLET POINTS):

Moto Service Log is the complete motorcycle maintenance tracker for riders who want to keep their machines in peak condition. Monitor service intervals with visual arc gauges, track fuel consumption, analyze costs, and access essential reference data.

Your main dashboard displays six animated arc-gauge indicators for oil, tires, chain, brakes, spark plugs, and coolant. Each gauge fills from green through yellow to red as service intervals approach or become overdue. A digital odometer display shows your current mileage at all times. Horizontal scrolling cards highlight upcoming and overdue tasks so you never miss critical maintenance.

Record every service event including oil changes, oil filter replacements, air filter changes, spark plug replacements, chain and sprocket work, tire swaps, brake pad replacements, coolant flushes, battery replacements, and general maintenance. Each record stores the date, odometer reading, cost, parts used, and notes. Search through your entire service history by keyword or filter by service type using quick-access filter chips.

Track every fuel fill-up with liters, price per liter, and odometer reading. The app automatically calculates your average fuel consumption in liters per hundred kilometers using the full-tank-to-full-tank method. View fuel cost trends with bar charts showing spending per fill-up over time. A live arc gauge on the fuel entry screen shows tank fill level relative to your bike's capacity.

Analyze your total spending with detailed cost breakdowns. A pie chart shows how your money is distributed across service types. A monthly trend chart displays stacked bars comparing service costs versus fuel costs over time. See total service cost, total fuel cost, and combined spending at a glance.

Access a built-in reference guide with three sections covering tire pressure specifications for sport, touring, and off-road motorcycles. Chain tension measurement guidelines include proper slack ranges, lubrication intervals, and replacement indicators. Fluid specifications cover engine oil ratings including JASO MA2 for wet clutch compatibility, coolant mixing ratios, and brake fluid types and replacement schedules.

Customize service intervals for each maintenance type in kilometers. The dashboard automatically calculates urgency based on the distance since your last recorded service. Set your motorcycle profile including name, make, model, year, current mileage, and fuel tank capacity.

Export all your data including bike profile, service records, and fuel entries as a JSON file using the built-in share function. Perfect for backup or transferring data.

Whether you ride a sportbike, touring machine, adventure bike, or naked roadster, Moto Service Log helps you ride with confidence knowing every service is tracked and every interval is monitored.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
Zero competition for visual gauge-based motorcycle maintenance tracking. Existing motorcycle apps focus on ride tracking or GPS routes, not maintenance management. This app provides a unique dashboard with animated arc gauges that show service urgency at a glance, something no other motorcycle app offers. The combination of service tracking, fuel logging, cost analytics, and reference data in one app replaces notebooks, spreadsheets, and multiple separate apps. The arc-gauge dashboard makes checking maintenance status as intuitive as reading your motorcycle's actual instrument cluster.
